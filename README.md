# University of East Anglia Brain And Eye Study (UEA BAES)

**Please note that this is an invitation only study with no open recruitment. Participants will be contacted via email regarding their participation in the study.**

UEA BAES is a new study that looks at the relationship between Alzheimer’s disease, genetics, and the eye, with the goal of identifying early biomarkers that may determine Alzheimer’s disease risk.

The health of the eye is increasingly understood to reflect the health of the brain. By using the eye as a window to the brain, we may be able to avoid using complex and expensive brain imaging techniques, and instead use equipment that is now available in most high street opticians.

As society ages, Alzheimer’s disease and dementia are becoming increasing prevalent. Identifying those at risk earlier may allow us to intervene at a stage in the disease where a treatment would be most effective.
