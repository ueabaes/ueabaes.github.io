# University of East Anglia Brain And Eye Study (UEA BAES)

**Please note that this is an invitation only study with no open recruitment. Participants will be contacted via email regarding their participation in the study.**

UEA BAES is a new study that looks at the relationship between Alzheimer’s disease, genetics, and the eye, with the goal of identifying early biomarkers that may determine Alzheimer’s disease risk.

The health of the eye is increasingly understood to reflect the health of the brain. By using the eye as a window to the brain, we may be able to avoid using complex and expensive brain imaging techniques, and instead use equipment that is now available in most high street opticians.

As society ages, Alzheimer’s disease and dementia are becoming increasing prevalent. Identifying those at risk earlier may allow us to intervene at a stage in the disease where a treatment would be most effective.


## Am I eligable to take part in the study?

**Inclusion criteria:**
- Known ApoE genotype determined in previous study.
- Over 45 years old.
- Fluent English speaker (including non-native speakers).

**Exclusion criteria:**
- History of neurodegenerative disorder.
- History of cardiovascular disease.
- History of vascular disease or sickle cell anaemia.
- History of Diabetes.
- History of photosensitive epilepsy or seizures.

If you have a history of severe visual impairment, please contact us.

## What is involved in taking part?
This is an observational study, so we won't be administering any trial drugs or treatments. Instead we will be recording specific aspects of your health.

In this study we are taking recordings in several ways:
- An EEG, measuring your brainwave response.This will be taken whilst resting, looking at a flashing light source, and performing a reaction test.
- Two cognitive questionnaires, one called ACE-II, the another called RUDAS. Both of which are used in clinical settings to screen for dementia.
- An OCT scan and pictures of your eyes. This also includes flashing lights.
- We will also ask your some questions about your health history.

**You can find further information in the Participant Information Sheet linked below.**
